## Inspiration
As college students,budget constraints has always been a reality we have to face.Not a day goes by without borrowing or lending money to your friends.In such context splitwise has become an integral part in campus life.Fampay as we all know,is the neobank for genz students.Our idea aims to unlock the true potential of Fampay by integrating it with splitwise making it the ultimate e-wallet for the genz students.
## What it does
1. College students can now lend and borrow money with their peers in an organized fashion keeping an account of their balances on Fampay.
2. It adds a fun gamified element in the form of spinning wheel.The one whose name pops pays for the treat!
3. Provides a peer to peer lending deliquency predictor so that you can now find out who is never going to pay you back :)
## How we built it
- The backbone of the website is made with Django framework.
- We integrated it with open source splitwise API's.
